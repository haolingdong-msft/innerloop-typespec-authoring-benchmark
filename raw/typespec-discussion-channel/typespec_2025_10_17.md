# Many Swagger ModelValidation Error:　XMS_EXAMPLE_NOTFOUND_ERROR

**Category: TypeSpec Validation**

## question 
This is my [PR](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/36687). And I got so many Swagger ModelValidation errors : XMS_EXAMPLE_NOTFOUND_ERROR ,  please check the [link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/actions/runs/18519995562/job/52777696829?pr=36687).
```
Error reported:

{
  code: 'XMS_EXAMPLE_NOTFOUND_ERROR',
  message: 'x-ms-example not found in Provider_GetAvailableStacks.',
  schemaUrl: 'specification/web/resource-manager/Microsoft.Web/AppService/stable/2025-03-01/openapi.json',
  exampleUrl: undefined,
  schemaPosition: { line: 456, column: 14 },
  schemaJsonPath: undefined,
  examplePosition: undefined,
  exampleJsonPath: undefined,
  severity: 0,
  source: 'global',
  operationId: 'Provider_GetAvailableStacks',
  level: '\x1B[31merror\x1B[39m'
}
...
```
 
Actually, there is not any related example in the operation in the origin swagger.
 
 
I could find the latest merged [PR](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/37883)  and it does not have the same problem.
 
Thanks for your support.

## answer
The errors are indicating that your operations are missing examples. ModelValidation requires an example for each operation, so the next steps are either to add examples or apply a suppression. Since ModelValidation has bugs in suppressions, you can unblock the PR by using the label Approved-ModelValidation, or alternatively, generate the missing examples.

# CI Failure – Swagger LintDiff

**Category: TypeSpec Validation**

## question 
Hi team,
 
We have a TypeSpec PR that fixes the README format, but the CI check Swagger LintDiff failed with the following error:
`[Exception] No input files provided.`
 
I’ve verified that all `input-file` paths exist in this PR. Could this be a bug, or did I miss something in the configuration?

Thank you!

## answer
if you are fixing bugs already in main, this is expected.  lintdiff needs to run on your spec both before and after your PR, and if before is crashing, the PR to fix it will still crash.

# Unknown decorator @flattenProperty

**Category: TypeSpec Migration**

## question 
I'm getting the below errors and something like this, which I had never run into before.  The target branch (which I based my dev branch from) of my PR didn't run into that either.  Looking for some advice or clue about what is causing this and how to fix, or perhaps bypass them.

## answer
your release branch has fallen far behind main.  it will need to be updated or recreated.
 
you can try this, but if your release branch is too old, it will likely need to be recreated
