# How can I edit the "Overview" text associated with a published REST API generated from TypeSpec?

## question 
I need to fix some text related to Authentication (we do not yet support api-key auth) here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/aifoundry/aiagents/?view=rest-aifoundry-aiagents-v1#authentication
 
This text does not come from the TypeSpec itself: https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/main/specification/ai/Azure.AI.Agents
 
Any idea where it's located and how I can edit it? Thanks!

This text is not present in the repository supporting Azure AI learn.microsoft pages: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs-pr

## answer
It comes from https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-rest-apis/blob/main/docs-ref-conceptual/aifoundry/aiagents/index.md

# Swagger LintDiff Suppression via TypeSpec

## question 
Hello all, we are trying to get our spec migration wrapped up, but we are unable to figure out a suppression for `PatchBodyParametersSchema Properties of a PATCH request body must not be required, property:name.`
 
Link to linter errors: [Migrate devcenter to TypeSpec · Azure/azure-rest-api-specs@82edee2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/actions/runs/17628981647)

This is because a couple of our resource definitions reference the `Sku` definition from ARM common types

I am unable to figure out a suppression for this in the readme with a directives ([examples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/82edee201bde3d1de2633221016530141567dd28/specification/devcenter/resource-manager/readme.md?plain=1#L43)
```
  - where:
    - $.definitions.PoolUpdate.properties.devBoxDefinition.sku
    suppress:
      - PatchBodyParametersSchema
```
), and the ARM reviewer has told me that this should be accomplished via a suppression in the TypeSpec. I can't seem to find any examples of this and would really appreciate any help! 

## answer
If you just need to add a suppression for the swagger error in LintDiff, see here:
 
https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Swagger-LintDiff#adding-scoped-suppressions
 
Also left a comment here, with a correction to the instructions provided by your ARM reviewer.
 
https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/pull/36201#discussion_r2342265620:
```
Currently, LintDiff errors can only be suppressed in readme.md, not *.tsp files or suppressions.yaml or anywhere else.

https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/wiki/Swagger-LintDiff#adding-scoped-suppressions

TypeSpec Linter errors should be suppressed in the *.tsp themselves.

## answer
It looks like your PR is against the main branch of the private repo - we don't check api specs into this branch.  The sdk failures for flattenProperty are due to those SDKs not being up-to-date with the latest version of typespec-client-generator-core, which was released earlier this week.  Since you are not checking this spec in to the main branch of the private repo, these can be safely ignored.
