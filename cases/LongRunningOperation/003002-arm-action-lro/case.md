## prompt

Add a move async operation to move employee, operation's request is MoveRequest, response is MoveResponse

### Input code

```ts
import "@typespec/rest";
import "@typespec/http";
import "@azure-tools/typespec-azure-core";
import "@azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager";

using TypeSpec.Rest;
using TypeSpec.Http;
using Azure.Core;
using Azure.ResourceManager;

namespace Microsoft.Widget;

/** Employee resource */
model Employee is TrackedResource<EmployeeProperties> {
  ...ResourceNameParameter<Employee>;
}

/** Employee properties */
model EmployeeProperties {
  /** Age of employee */
  age?: int32;

  /** City of employee */
  city?: string;

  /** Profile of employee */
  @encode("base64url")
  profile?: bytes;

  /** The status of the last operation. */
  @visibility(Lifecycle.Read)
  provisioningState?: ProvisioningState;
}

/** The resource provisioning state. */
@lroStatus
union ProvisioningState {
  ResourceProvisioningState,

  /** The resource is being provisioned */
  Provisioning: "Provisioning",

  /** The resource is updating */
  Updating: "Updating",

  /** The resource is being deleted */
  Deleting: "Deleting",

  /** The resource create request has been accepted */
  Accepted: "Accepted",

  string,
}

/** Employee move request */
model MoveRequest {
  /** The moving from location */
  from: string;

  /** The moving to location */
  to: string;
}

/** Employee move response */
model MoveResponse {
  /** The status of the move */
  movingStatus: string;
}

@armResourceOperations
interface Employees {
  get is ArmResourceRead<Employee>;
  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<Employee>;
  update is ArmResourcePatchSync<Employee, EmployeeProperties>;
  delete is ArmResourceDeleteWithoutOkAsync<Employee>;
  listByResourceGroup is ArmResourceListByParent<Employee>;
  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Employee>;
}

```

### Expected output code

```ts
@armResourceOperations
interface Employees {
  get is ArmResourceRead<Employee>;
  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<Employee>;
  update is ArmResourcePatchSync<Employee, EmployeeProperties>;
  delete is ArmResourceDeleteWithoutOkAsync<Employee>;
  listByResourceGroup is ArmResourceListByParent<Employee>;
  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Employee>;
  move is ArmResourceActionAsync<Employee, MoveRequest, MoveResponse, LroHeaders = ArmCombinedLroHeaders<FinalResult = MoveResponse> &
      Azure.Core.Foundations.RetryAfterHeader>;
}
```

According to RPC, https://github.com/cloud-and-ai-microsoft/resource-provider-contract/blob/master/v1.0/async-api-reference.md#call-action-post-asynchronously, new Resource Provider namespace implementations must include the Azure-AsyncOperation header in their async responses. So `LroHeaders = ArmCombinedLroHeaders<FinalResult = MoveResponse>` should be added.
