```tsp
@armResourceOperations

  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<Employee>;
  update is ArmResourcePatchSync<Employee, EmployeeProperties>;
  delete is ArmResourceDeleteWithoutOkAsync<Employee>;

### Result

fail, according to RPC, https://github.com/cloud-and-ai-microsoft/resource-provider-contract/blob/master/v1.0/async-api-reference.md#call-action-post-asynchronously, new Resource Provider namespace implementations must include the Azure-AsyncOperation header in their async responses. So `LroHeaders = ArmCombinedLroHeaders<FinalResult = MoveResponse>` should be added. But it is not added.
